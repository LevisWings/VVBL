# VVBL (Vulnerable Virtual Boxes List)

VVBL is a list of vulnerable "boxes"/virtual machines collected from different platforms, where their attack techniques, services, operating system, difficulty, platform, etc. are specified. This list only works in the notes application, Notion. When you enter the template, there will be a section explaining how to obtain it.
