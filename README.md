VVBL is a list of vulnerable virtual "boxes" (also known as machines) where their different properties and attributes are specified. This list only works in the notes application, Notion.

## How to get this template?
As mentioned at the beginning, to get this list you need a Notion account. You can register for free and, after that, follow the steps below:
- Click on "Duplicate" -> Select your workspace -> Done.

## Information on the properties of the "boxes"
|Name|Properties|
|---|---|
|1. Box|Name of the box (also called virtual machine).|
|2. Properties|Properties of the boxes are shown, such as the platforms they belong to (HackTheBox, TryHackMe, etc.), the difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard and Insane), the level of realism of the machine (ctf, ctf/realistic, realistic), the operating system (Windows, Unix, etc.), free or paid?|
|2.9 All Services/Software|All services and software in the "box" are displayed.|
|3. Pentest Services/Software|The services and software that will need to be audited/interacted to resolve the "box" are shown.|
|4. Before shell|The attributes (attack techniques/types) of a virtual machine are displayed, before obtaining an interactive shell (not applicable in all cases).|
|5. After shell|The attributes (attack techniques/types) of a virtual machine are shown, after obtaining an interactive shell.|

## How to filter by certain properties/attributes of a box?
In Notion, we can use the "**Filter**" functionality, to filter by certain properties/attributes. In the following example, we filter by boxes where we have to interact with the Kerberos service:

- Click "Filter" -> Add a Filter -> Add a filter -> Play with the conditionals to filter by a specific attribute -> Done
